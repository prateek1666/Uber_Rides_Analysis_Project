🚗 Uber Rides Analysis Project

📌 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze Uber ride data to uncover trends in customer behavior, trip distribution, and peak usage times. Using Python for data exploration and Power BI for visualization, the analysis aims to provide insights that can support operational efficiency and customer engagement strategies.

❓ Key Questions / KPIs Addressed

What are the peak hours and days for Uber rides?

Which purpose of trips (e.g., Business vs. Personal) dominates the ride data?

What is the average distance and duration of rides?

Which months show higher ride frequency?

Which locations see the most Uber activity?

How do ride trends vary across business days and weekends?

🔧 Process Followed

🧹 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (Python)
Imported dataset and reviewed structure.

Removed duplicates and handled missing values.

Converted Start Date and End Date to datetime objects.

Extracted new features: Hour, Day, Month, Weekday, Duration.

📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
Used matplotlib and seaborn for:

Ride frequency by hour, weekday, and month.

Purpose-wise trip distribution.

Most visited start and end locations.

Distance analysis across various trip types.

📈 3. Dashboard Development (Power BI)
Built an interactive dashboard including:

Maps and bar charts for location-based insights.

Time-based slicers for month, hour, and day.

KPIs: Total Rides, Average Distance, Most Common Purpose.

Filters for ride purpose, city, and date range.

📊 Project Insights

Business travel is the most common ride purpose, showing Uber's strong appeal to professionals.

Peak ride times occur in the morning (7–9 AM) and evening (5–7 PM) hours.

Wednesday is the most active day for Uber rides, with weekends showing a dip in ride frequency.

April and December see the highest monthly ride volumes.

Frequent locations include New York, San Francisco, and Chicago, indicating urban ride demand.

Ride durations tend to be longer during off-peak hours and on weekends.

✅ Conclusion

The Uber Rides Analysis project offers detailed insights into customer behavior, usage trends, and city-level demand patterns. Combining Python-based analytics with Power BI dashboards creates a powerful platform for stakeholders to make data-informed decisions. Future enhancements may include:

Real-time trip tracking.

Forecasting ride demand using time-series models.

Cost optimization strategies for high-demand routes.
